            JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time
            compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it
            is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
            non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache
            CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based,
            multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting
            object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional
            programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not
            the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments.
            For information about APIs specific to Web pages, please see Web
            APIs and DOM.
          </p>
          <p>
            The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern
            browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at
            least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published
            the sixth major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called
            ECMAScript 2015, and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or
            ES6. Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles.
            This documentation refers to the latest draft version, which is
            currently ECMAScript 2020.

            Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both
            "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of
            Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming
            languages have very different syntax, semantics, and uses.

            JavaScript first steps Answers some fundamental questions such as
            "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", and "what can it
            do?", along with discussing key JavaScript features such as
            variables, strings, numbers, and arrays. JavaScript building blocks
            Continues our coverage of JavaScript's key fundamental features,
            turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code blocks
            such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events.
            Introducing JavaScript objects The object-oriented nature of
            JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with
            your knowledge of the language and write more efficient code,
            therefore we've provided this module to help you. Asynchronous
            JavaScript Discusses asynchronous JavaScript, why it is important,
            and how it can be used to effectively handle potential blocking
            operations such as fetching resources from a server. Client-side web
            APIs Explores what APIs are, and how to use some of the most common
            APIs you'll come across often in your development work.

            Intermediate A re-introduction to JavaScript An overview for those
            who think they know about JavaScript. JavaScript data structures
            Overview of available data structures in JavaScript. Equality
            comparisons and sameness JavaScript provides three different
            value-comparison operations: strict equality using <code>===</code>,
            loose equality using <code>==</code>, and the
            <code>Object.is()</code> method. Closures A closure is the
            combination of a function and the lexical environment within which
            that function was declared.

            Advanced Inheritance and the prototype chain Explanation of the
            widely misunderstood and under-estimated prototype-based
            inheritance. Strict mode Strict mode defines that you can not use
            any variable before initializing it. It is a restricted variant of
            ECMAScript 5, for faster performance and easier debugging.
            JavaScript typed arrays JavaScript typed arrays provide a mechanism
            for accessing raw binary data. Memory Management Memory life cycle
            and garbage collection in JavaScript. Concurrency model and Event
            Loop JavaScript has a concurrency model based on an "event loop".
